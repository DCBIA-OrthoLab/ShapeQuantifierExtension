# Shape Quantifier

## Description

This extension contains different modules that allow the user to either quantify differences between two models or make measurements on the shape of a model.

The user will first have the possibility to make some preprocessing on the models by cropping them (EasyClip) and/or making registration between models (SurfaceRegistration).

Then he will have the choice to compute distances between points (Q3DC) or angles between lines (Q3DC) or planes (AnglePlanes).

He will finally be able to create distance maps (ModelToModelDistance) to either display them as color maps (ShapePopulationViewer) or compute statistics ( MeshStatistics) on the entire model or just a region of interest (PickAndPaint).

All those modules will be available to use by themselves or all at once by using ShapeQuantifier that will guide the user through the different steps.
